# sub pop

How much am I spending on all of these subscriptions, anyway? I don't even know
any more. There are a bunch of streaming services (video and audio), some Substacks
and Patreons, a couple of IRL magazines, some video game premium services, god I don't
even know what else. I feel like I'm spending a bunch of money and not getting as much
value as I should! 

Sub Pop is a dumb little subscription tracker with the goal of helping to solve that
problem. It is very much a work in progress.
